# WebDev Workspace

Browser based workspace to store project information and launch various tools and apps for working on your projects.

I got tired of having to find my apps, tools and confiurations whenever I wanted to work on my projects.

## How it Works

Currently this only works on Macs with iTerm. Native mac apps are opened via iTerm that has been configure with a profile for _telnet_.

As an example using a url like `"'telnet:///usr/local/bin/gittower ' + project.root"` will open git-tower for the current project.
